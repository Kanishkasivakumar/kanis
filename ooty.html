	<h2 class="ji">Etymology</h2>
	<p>
	The origin of the name is obscure. The first known written mention of the place is given as Wotokymund in a letter of March 1821 to the Madras Gazette from an unknown correspondent.In early times it was called Ottakal Mandu. The name probably changed under British rule from Udhagamandalam to Ootacamund, and later was shortened to Ooty.<br>
	The first part of the name is probably a corruption of the local name for the central region of the Nilgiri Plateau. Otha-Cal literally means "single stone". This is perhaps a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people."Mund" is the Anglicised form of the Toda word for a village, Mandu.<br>
	Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the "blue mountains", so named due to the Kurunji flower which blooms every twelve years giving the slopes a bluish tinge.
