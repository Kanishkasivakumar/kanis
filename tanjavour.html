<h2 class="ji">Etymology</h2>
<p>The city's name is believed to be derived from the term 'thanjam puguntha oor' which means "the town for refugees", Thanjam puguntha oor-Thanjavur. The term also refers to the hospitality of the natives.However, according to a local legend, the word Thanjavur was derived from "Tanjan", who was a Demon[2][3] who was killed on this very place and that asura asked to make a beautiful city there in Hindu mythology and later the asura(giant) was killed in what is now Thanjavur (formerly Tanjore) by the Hindu god Neelamegha Perumal, a form of Vishnu. The city's name "Thanjavur" might also be derived from the name of a Mutharayar king, "Thananjay" or "Dhananjaya". Thananjaya (Dhananjaya) added to -Oor gives the name Thanjavur. The Kalamalla stone inscription (the first stone inscription) was made by the Renati Chola king, Erikal Muthuraju Dhanunjaya Varma of 575 CE</p>
