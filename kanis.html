	<b><h2>Now we dicuss about B.Sc.Information Technology:</h2></b>
	<p>This is bachelor's degree awarded for an undergradyate program in the information technology.The degree is normally required in order to work in the information technology industry.</p>
	<br>
	<p>A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc IT) degree program typically takes three to four years depending on the country. This degree is primarily focused on subjects such as software, databases, and networking. In general, computer science degrees tend to focus on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing rather than emphasizing specific technologies.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The degree is a Bachelor of Science degree with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information technology and related fields. This degree is awarded for completing a program of study in the field of software development, software testing, software engineering, web design, databases, programming, computer networking and computer systems.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Graduates with an information technology background are able to perform technology tasks relating to the processing, storing, and communication of information between computers, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. Information technology as a field emphasizes the secure management of large amounts of variable information and its accessibility via a wide variety of systems both local and worldwide.</p>
<br>
<br>
	<p>Generally, software and information technology companies look for people who have strong programming skills, system analysis, and software testing skills.</p>

	<p>Many colleges teach practical skills that are crucial to becoming a software developer. As logical reasoning and critical thinking are important in becoming a software professional, this degree encompasses the complete process of software development from software design and development to final testing.</p>

	<p>Students who complete their undergraduate education in software engineering at a satisfactory level often pursue graduate studies such as a Master of Science in Information Technology (M.Sc IT) and sometimes continuing onto a doctoral program and earning a doctorate such as a Doctor of Information Technology (DIT).</p>
